# SLAM
This repository consists the entire solution code for the course SLAM - by Claus Brenner. All solutions have been written in Python 3. You can find the video tutorials on YouTube.

Here is the link to the YouTube tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2qzYCeT9oQ&list=PLpUPoM7Rgzi_7YWn14Va2FODh7LzADBSm

The tutorials are in Python 2, which I have modified to Python 3.6. I have tried to fix all bugs related to this as and when I faced them.

Solution code has been uploaded unit-wise. The lego_robot.py file and logfile_viewer.py file is different for each unit, because I have modified them as per bug fixes required unit-wise.
Hence, I suggest you to download/copy them unit-wise as well. 

Or: You may try using the lego_robot.py and logfile_viewer.py files of Unit_G throughout because being the last unit, it would have bugs fixed for all units. However, I would still suggest using it unit-wise.

This is a wonderful course and very nicely taught. I hope you have fun learning it. Good day!
